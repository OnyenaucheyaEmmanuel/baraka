      <h4 class="resume-title">Statement of Philosophy</h4>
      <div class="resume-item">
        <p>As an advocate for early childhood education, I believe in fostering a nurturing and inclusive environment where every child is valued, respected, and empowered to reach their full potential. My core beliefs center around the importance of child-centered learning, holistic development, and collaborative partnerships.I believe in honoring each child's unique interests, strengths, and learning styles, and fostering a curriculum that is responsive and relevant to their individual needs. I am committed to supporting children's cognitive, social-emotional, physical, and creative growth, recognizing the interconnectedness of these domains in shaping their overall development.
          
      <h4 class="resume-title">Approaches</h4>
      <div class="resume-item">
        <p>I embrace play-based learning as a foundation for children's exploration, discovery, and self-expression, providing opportunities for hands-on, experiential learning that sparks curiosity and fosters a love for learning. 
          I believe in an emergent curriculum approach, where learning emerges from children's interests, questions, and experiences, allowing for flexibility and responsiveness to children's evolving needs and interests.
          I strive to be a responsive and reflective educator, adapting my teaching practices to meet the diverse needs of each child, providing scaffolding and support as they navigate their learning journey.</p>
      </div>  

          <!-- As an educator in early childhood education, my philosophy is grounded in the belief that every child is a unique individual with boundless potential and deserves to be nurtured and supported in their learning journey. I am committed to creating a warm, inclusive, and stimulating environment where children feel safe, valued, and empowered to explore, discover, and grow. 
          </p>
    </div> -->

      <!-- <h4 class="resume-title">Core Beliefs</h4>
      <div class="resume-item">
        <p>  
          I value collaborative partnerships with families, colleagues, and the community, understanding that by working together, we can create a supportive and enriching educational experience for all children. </p>

          Markers or Crayon. <br>
          Glue. <br>
          </p>
      </div>
      <h4 class="resume-title">Procedure</h4>
      <div class="resume-item">
        <h5>Introduction:</h5>
        <p>Start by taking the children on a short nature walk, within the school environment. Encourage them to collect intersting natural materials they find along the way.
          </p>
          <h5>Main Activity 1: Creative Art</h5>
          <p>Once back indoors, I provided each pupil with a large sheet of paper or cardboard as their canvas. <br>Showed them how to arrange and glue the collected materials onto the paper to create a collage. Encouraged them to use their imagination and creativity to design patterns, shapes or even scenes.
            </p>
            <h5>Main Activity 2: Collaborative Work</h5>
            <p>I let the children experiment freely with the materials, offering guidance and support as needed. <br>After the collage were completed, I encouraged the children to share their creations with each other, explaining the choices they made and the stories behind their artwork.  
            </p>
            <h5>Main Activity 3: Counting and Building</h5>
            <p>Ask them to count the numer of natural materialsthey gathered along the way. <br>This Integrates maths concept while reinforcing the idea of natural art.  
            </p>
            <h5>Closure and Reflection</h5>
            <p>The Children use markers or crayons to add extra details or designs to their collage. <br>This activity encourages the children to explore nature,use their imagination and develop fine motor skills through arranging and gluing materials. It also provided an opportunity for self-expression and creativity as they design their own unique collages.
              </p>

      <h4 class="resume-title">Case Study</h4>
      <div  class="resume-item">
        <p>An assignment was given in Language Arts Methods and Intervention [ECP 806]. Where I identified a child with reading problem and used phoenics instruction to help the child with reading problem between age 9-12yrs to be able to read again with the help of an abstract short paragraph story at the beginning which after using the phoenics instruction to train the child, I gave the short story paragraph again after some weeks of training the child which was scored at both intervals from the onset and at the end of the training.

        <p>There was a time during my stay at victory school where I was a pry 1 class teacher when I noticed that my pupils usually one at least must complain of their pen being misplaced.
